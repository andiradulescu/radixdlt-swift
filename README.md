## Features
* TBD

## Getting started

### 0. Install Xcode 10

Install it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

**Make sure that you have a simulator installed**, by starting Xcode - agree to Terms and Conditions and install any additional dependency if needed - navigate to *Settings -> Components* and verify that you see at least one installed *iPhone Simulator* in the list.

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:radixdlt/radixdlt-swift.git && cd radixdlt-swift`
```

### 2. Install `brew`
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Issues?
[See brew troubleshooting page](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting)

### 3. Install `carthage`
```bash
brew install carthage
```

#### Issues?
If that command says that Carthage needs **linking** (maybe it was already installed but not linked) with a permissions error similar to the one below:
```bash
Warning: carthage 0.31.2 is already installed, it's just not linked
You can use `brew link carthage` to link this version.
$ brew link carthage
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/carthage/0.31.2... Error: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks
```

Then you can fix that by running:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Frameworks && \
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Frameworks && \
brew link carthage
```

Which makes sure that your current user is owning that directory, therefore `brew link` can **sudoless** - which is needed. For more info about this issue, [please refer to this Gist](https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/7732946).

### 4. Install `swiftlint`
```bash
brew install swiftlint`
```

#### Issues?
If you have any issues [go to swiftlint repo](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)


### 5. Install dependencies using Carthage
Please make sure that your **current directory is the _root of the repo_** (as per previous instructions).
```bash
carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --cache-builds
```

#### Issues?
If that fails you might need to install some additional tools:
```bash
brew install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
````

Which suggests adding some exports in your shell profile, try:

```bash
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
```

### 6. Run tests
Open the project:
```bash
open RadixSDK.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode run the tests by pressing `CMD` + `U`, verify that everything is working. 

## Architecture

To be written.

## Design choices

### Why Carthage?
As of 2019-01-14, [BitcoinKit doesn't build using Cocoapods](https://github.com/yenom/BitcoinKit/issues/193). But it works fine using Carthage.

### Why RxSwift based APIs?
First of all, all the existing Radix Libraries are Rx based, secondly because it makes perfect sense since it makes async programming easy.

## Dependencies

You will find the dependencies in the [Cartfile](Cartfile), but we will go through the most important ones here:

- [BitcoinKit](https://github.com/yenom/BitcoinKit):
Elliptic Curve Cryptography, this library is one of the better Swift wrappers of the C library [bitcoin-core/secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1).

- [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift):
For standard crypto utilities such as hash functions.

- [BigInt](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt):
Support for big numbers.

- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift):
The library uses RxSwift for async programming.
